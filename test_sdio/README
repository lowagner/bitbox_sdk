This is an example of loading an image file from SD then displaying it (effectivemy streaming) 

The lower color band has the following meaning : 

red : initial value
yellow : ok mount fat fs
green : file opened
cyan : read data
blue : header OK
pink : last header OK

The emulator works, "SD" files should be located in the current directory.
