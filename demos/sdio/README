This is an example of loading an image file from SD then displaying it (effectively streaming).
It will also test writing to a file by creating it and increasing a 2-digits number on it from 01 to 02 .. 
Don't forget to put the image.raw file on the root of your sd card.

The lower color band has the following meaning : 

red : initial value
yellow : ok mount fat fs
green : file opened
cyan : read data
blue : header OK
pink : last header OK

The emulator works, "SD" files should be located in the current directory.
